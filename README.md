This repository contains a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator created using Flutter, The purpose of this project is to provide a simple and user-friendly BMI calculator app that allows users to calculate their BMI based on their height and weight.

Features

BMI Categories: The app categorizes the calculated BMI into different categories (underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity) to provide users with an understanding of their weight status.
